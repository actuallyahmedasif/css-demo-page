# CSS Projects Demo

This repository contains a collection of simple CSS demo pages created to practice and showcase my CSS skills.  
Each page focuses on a different styling concept like buttons, text formatting, layouts, and product pages.

## ðŸ“‚ Pages Included

This project is created as part of my CSS learning journey to demonstrate basic webpage styling and layout building skills.  
It includes examples of:

- Styling text and headings
- Creating buttons with hover effects
- Designing simple layouts and product cards
